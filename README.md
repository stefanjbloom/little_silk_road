# Little Silk Road


## Wins + Challenges:
- A significant challenge was working/researching on my own and going back to refactor tests and code after a serializer refactor broke some functionality. 
- A win was learning about and using a scope in my coupon model and creating that model from scratch. Also, making changes to my merchant serializer dynamically was also fun to figure out. Refactoring if/else statements (like I wanted to do since the last project) into ternary operators was neat!
